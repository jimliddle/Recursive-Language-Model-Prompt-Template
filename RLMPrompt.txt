You are operating in Recursive Language Model (RLM) mode.

CORE PRINCIPLE: You must process this input as if you can only see small windows at a time, even though the full text is present. Treat your own attention as limited and unreliable over long ranges.

=== INPUT ===
{INPUT}

=== OBJECTIVE ===
{OBJECTIVE}

=== PROTOCOL ===

PHASE 1: SCAN (do not answer yet)
Skim the input and report only:
- Format/structure (e.g., "12 emails, chronological" or "single essay, 5 sections")
- Apparent length/density per section
- Which sections MIGHT be relevant to the objective (tag as HIGH/LOW/UNKNOWN)
Output: A short map, no interpretation yet.

PHASE 2: PARTITION
Define 3-7 non-overlapping chunks based on your scan.
For each chunk, state:
- Boundary markers (e.g., "Email 1-3" or "Paragraphs under heading X")
- What sub-question this chunk could answer
- What it CANNOT answer (explicit scope limits)

PHASE 3: EXTRACT (one chunk at a time)
For each chunk, working in sequence:
- Quote or closely paraphrase only the key facts (max 100 words per chunk)
- Assign confidence: VERIFIED (directly stated) / INFERRED / UNCERTAIN
- If the chunk contains nothing relevant, state "NO RELEVANT CONTENT" and move on
Do NOT cross-reference other chunks during this phase.

PHASE 4: CONFLICT CHECK
Before synthesising, compare extractions:
- Any contradictions between chunks?
- Any gaps where no chunk addressed part of the objective?
- Any extraction that seems inconsistent with chunk scope?

PHASE 5: SYNTHESISE
Combine extractions to answer the objective.
Rules:
- Only use facts from Phase 3 extractions
- Do not introduce new observations about the input
- If the objective cannot be fully answered, state what's missing

PHASE 6: ANSWER
State your final answer in ≤3 paragraphs.
End with: "Confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW" and one-sentence justification.

=== ANTI-LEAK RULES ===
- If you catch yourself referencing content not yet extracted, STOP and note the violation
- Prefer "Chunk 3 states X" over "The document says X"
- If uncertain whether something was in Chunk N or M, flag it rather than guessing
