# For very long documents, add iteration:
If any chunk is still too large to extract confidently, 
return to PHASE 2 and sub-partition that chunk only.
Maximum recursion depth: 3

# For adversarial/tricky inputs:
PHASE 0: STATE YOUR PRIORS
Before scanning, write what you would GUESS the answer 
might be based on the objective alone. This makes it 
harder to retrofit reasoning to a premature conclusion.

# For multi-document inputs:
Treat each document as a separate partition in Phase 2.
Cross-document synthesis only happens in Phase 5.
